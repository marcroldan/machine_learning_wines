# ML Wines Project

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting wine quality and colour using various features. 
The analysis is conducted using Python and includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to apply various machine learning techniques to a dataset containing information about different types of wines. 
The main objective is to predict the quality and colour of wines based on their chemical properties. 

This analysis includes:

- Data preprocessing, including normalization and feature scaling.
- Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models such as Random Forest, SVM, and Naive Bayes.
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA.
- Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
- Optimization of hyperparameters using Grid Search.
- Use of pipelines for efficient workflow management.

## Files in the Repository

- `ML_wines.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the entire analysis, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
